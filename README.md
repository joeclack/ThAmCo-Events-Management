ThreeAmigos Corp is an event management company that arranges and oversees a range of
functions, including conferences, parties and weddings for its clients. As well as logistics,
ThreeAmigos Corp organises the catering and staffing for events.

You have been given the responsibility of constructing a new intranet-based prototype system for
the events management team. The internal system will be used by ThreeAmigos Corp staff to
perform the key operations:

  1. Manage event details;
  2. Assign staff to events;
  3. Attach guests to events;
  4. Assign food orders to events.

A system architecture and data model have been agreed upon by all stakeholders. It has been
decided that an existing web service will be used for reserving event venues.
It has also been decided that catering will be created as an independent web service because of the
potential for selling on as a third-party service to other companies.
The system architecture and data model are documented below.
